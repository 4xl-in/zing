<p>Well, sometimes it's necessary.</p>

<p>
  As a developer we usually work on different branches or we need to switch 
  branches.
  Sometimes we need to abandon some changes.

{% highlight log %}
$ git shash list

{% endhighlight %}

With the current approach we know exactly what a specific stash consists of:
